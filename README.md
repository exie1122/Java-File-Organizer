# Java-File-Organizer


(Mini project created to learn Java and Swing instead of just creating the boring terminal apps)

Have you ever wanted to clean up your PNG - ridden desktop? Maybe you're a Unity developer and your .FBX model files are all over the place and you need to organize them into a single folder for improved ease of use.

This is a small side project that I made with Java and Swing. Takes specified file type from one place and moves it to another.
