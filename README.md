# Java-File-Organizer


(Mini project created to learn Java and Swing instead of just creating the boring terminal apps)

Have you ever wanted to clean up your PNG - ridden desktop? Maybe you're a Unity developer and your .FBX model files are all over the place and you need to organize them into a single folder for improved ease of use.

This lil java + swing project I made takes care of that, by taking user input that specifies the file type and then moving them to the target directories.
